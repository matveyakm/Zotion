# Zotion

Zotion is a browser extension that modifies the interface of Notion-based websites.  
It is primarily aimed at improving the efficiency of study and revision workflows for students.

This project is a **coursework project** developed within the Department of Modern Programming at the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics, Saint Petersburg State University (SPbU).

> ðŸš§ The extension is currently at an early stage of development.

## ðŸ“Œ Planned Functionality

- **Flexible text formatting**  
  Allow authors to customize the appearance of text in more ways, improving emphasis and visual association.

- **Annotations**  
  Allow authors to hide less relevant information in collapsible pop-up annotations.

- **Free layout canvas**  
  Provide a field where authors can place and move objects freely, enabling infographics and "knowledge maps."

- **Block templates**  
  Enable authors to define and reuse block patterns to save time and maintain consistency.

- **Enhanced KaTeX integration**  
  Upgrade the formula editor to support more intuitive and efficient math input.

- **Improved table handling**  
  Allow changes to cell background, text alignment, and merging of cells.

- **Exam preparation mode (revision mode)**  
  Allow readers to hide definitions, theorems, and proofs under clickable overlays to encourage active recall.

- **Flashcard-style review questions**  
  Let readers test themselves using author-defined questions in a Q&A format.

- **Video synchronization**  
  Link content with video timestamps to enable synchronized reading and watching.

- **Focus timer**  
  Allow readers to set break reminders to support structured study sessions.

- **Browsing history and self-assessment**  
  Let readers track their reading progress and self-evaluate their understanding over time.
